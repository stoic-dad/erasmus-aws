## 🎯 **Recommended Approach for Your Project**

I recommend **Option 1 (draw.io + AWS Icons)** because:
- ✅ **Free and professional**
- ✅ **Official AWS icons**
- ✅ **High-quality exports**
- ✅ **Easy to maintain and update**
- ✅ **Industry standard**

## 📊 **Architecture Diagrams We Should Create**

### 1. **High-Level System Architecture**
- User flow from web dashboard to results
- All AWS services with official icons
- Data flow arrows and relationships

### 2. **Detailed Component Diagram**
- Lambda internal components
- API Gateway endpoints
- S3 bucket structure
- DynamoDB schema

### 3. **Security Architecture**
- IAM roles and policies
- Encryption boundaries
- Network security layers

### 4. **Data Flow Diagram**
- Step-by-step SBOM processing
- CVE analysis workflow
- Executive reporting pipeline

## 🛠️ **Let me create these for you!**

I can:
1. **Create draw.io XML files** with your architecture
2. **Generate professional diagrams** using official AWS icons
3. **Export high-quality images** for your documentation
4. **Update all README files** with new diagrams

Would you like me to:
- Create the draw.io XML files with your architecture?
- Generate specific diagram types (system, security, data flow)?
- Update your documentation with the new professional diagrams?
