# üñºÔ∏è Final Steps for Architecture Diagram Completion

## üìã Diagram Export Instructions

The architecture diagrams have been created in draw.io format with official AWS icons. To complete the process, follow these steps to export the diagrams:

### Step 1: Export Diagrams
1. Download and install draw.io desktop application from https://www.diagrams.net/
2. Open the following files:
   - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/erasmus-aws-architecture.drawio`
   - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/erasmus-dataflow-diagram.drawio`
3. For each diagram, export as PNG:
   - File ‚Üí Export As ‚Üí PNG...
   - Enable "Transparent Background"
   - Set "Scale" to 2.0 (or 300 DPI)
   - Save to:
     - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/exports/erasmus-aws-architecture-professional.png`
     - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/exports/erasmus-dataflow-professional.png`
4. For each diagram, export as SVG:
   - File ‚Üí Export As ‚Üí SVG...
   - Enable "Transparent Background"
   - Save to:
     - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/exports/erasmus-aws-architecture-professional.svg`
     - `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/exports/erasmus-dataflow-professional.svg`

### Step 2: Remove Placeholder Files
After exporting the actual PNG and SVG files, remove the placeholder files:
```bash
rm /Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/architecture/exports/*.placeholder
```

### Step 3: Final Documentation Check
Ensure all documentation files correctly reference the exported diagram files:
- `README.md`
- `README_FINAL.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_DETAILED.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_ENHANCED.md`

### Step 4: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add professional AWS architecture diagrams with official icons"
git push origin main
```

## üéØ Project Completion

With these steps completed, the Erasmus SBOM Risk Analyzer project will have professional, visually appealing AWS architecture diagrams that accurately represent the system architecture and data flow.

Key benefits achieved:
1. **Professional Presentation**: Official AWS architecture icons provide a professional look
2. **Clear Communication**: Easier to understand system architecture and data flow
3. **Maintainability**: Source .drawio files allow easy updates as architecture evolves
4. **Documentation Enhancement**: All documentation now references professional diagrams

The diagram files are organized in a logical structure:
- `architecture/` - Main directory for architecture assets
  - `*.drawio` - Source files for editing
  - `exports/` - Directory for exported PNG and SVG files
  - `EXPORT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed export instructions
  - `README.md` - Overview of architecture diagrams
  - `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Guide for working with draw.io

Congratulations on enhancing the Erasmus SBOM Risk Analyzer project with professional architecture diagrams!
