## üö© Remaining Steps

### For Final Completion:
1. **Export the Diagrams**:
   - Follow instructions in `/Users/rohitsurya/erasmus-aws-1/FINAL_EXPORT_STEPS.md`
   - Use draw.io desktop application to export PNG and SVG files
   - Save to the `architecture/exports/` directory

2. **Remove Placeholder Files**:
   - Delete `.placeholder` files after creating actual exports

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to GitHub repository

## üåü Key Benefits Delivered

1. **Enhanced Visual Communication**:
